- I used openCV (LBPHFaceRecognizer) in python to train a model that will recognize faces in people data folder
- You have to run train_model.py first in your IDE terminal (python train_model.py) and you will have lbph_classifier.yml file and this file will be used to recognize faces
- When you had the file, you have to run face_recognition_camera.py and camera will be turned on
